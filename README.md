You are required to implement a small set of mechanics working over the network.
Preferably, use C++ (for simplicity and clarity of expression).

Top-Down Control System (top-down/isometric view, etc.) for the camera and game character. Here are some conditions:

- There should be an option to switch characters during gameplay (implementation not required).
- Characters do not have to be humanoids or living beings at all (e.g., a car).
- There should be the ability to freely move the camera independently of the character.
- The character moves to the point of a click on the landscape/surface.

Besides the player's character(s), it is necessary to create several interactive objects (buttons/levers/pressure platforms) to open doors/turn on lights, change the color of materials/lighting, etc. (a simple interaction system).
